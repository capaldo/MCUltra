# Introduction
A collaborative MCAT deck containing premed95's (reformatted), Ortho528 (reformatted), and my own cards. My cards stem from EK and KhanAcademy.

## Why?
The idea is to use Github and the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) plugin to facilitate collaboration among premeds with the hopes of producing a repository of cards. 

## How?
To add cards AND contribute to the repository, there's two ways to go about it. Both require you to sign up for a Github account.

# Making Changes

## Option 1 – Create an Issue
Create an [issue](https://github.com/capaldo/MCUltra/issues/new) with one of the following templates:

### Revision
If you notice a card is wrong, make an issue with the following:
```markdown
Reason: Revision
Card ID:
Correction:
```

### Addition
If a piece of important information is not on a card, include it using this template:
```markdown
Front:
Back:
Images (Optional):
Website (Optional):
Tags:
```

For tags, please make something along the lines of the following formatting:
#### SOURCE::IDENTIFIERS
* For example: 
```
KhanAcademy::Biomolecules::Carbohydrate
```
```
EK::BIO1::Lecture2
```
#### SUBJECTAREA::TOPIC::SUBTOPIC
* For example:
```
BC::DNA
```
```
BIO::CirculatorySystem::Heart
```

## Option 2 – Make a Pull Request
For an in-depth explanation on how to do this, please refer to [this section](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki#how-to-collaborate-via-github) on the CrowdAnki page.
