A collaborative MCAT deck containing premed95's (reformatted), Ortho528 (reformatted), and my own cards. My cards stem from EK and KhanAcademy. Some cards may not display properly due to the theme I currently am using. Currently working on a stripped down, text/image only solution but for the time being this is what I'll be able to put up. If you're interested in installing the theme, take a look over at my other repo: [ankibw](https://github.com/capaldo/ankiBW).
