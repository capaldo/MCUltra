# MCUltra
A collaborative MCAT deck containing premed95's (reformatted), Ortho528 (reformatted), and my own cards. My cards stem from EK and KhanAcademy.

## Why?
The idea is to use Github and the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) plugin to facilitate collaboration among premeds with the hopes of producing a repository of cards. 

## How?
To add cards AND contribute to the repository, there's two ways to go about it. Both require you to sign up for a Github account.

### Option 1
Create an [issue](https://github.com/capaldo/MCUltra/issues/new) with one of the following templates:

#### Revision
If you notice a card is wrong, make an issue with the following:
```markdown
Reason: Revision
Card ID:
Correction:
```

#### Addition
If a piece of important information is not on a card, include it using this template:
```markdown
Front:
Back:
Images (Optional):
Website (Optional):
Tags:
```

For tags, please make something along the lines of the following formatting:
* SOURCE::Identifiers
    - For example: 
	* KhanAcademy::Biomolecules::Carbohydrates
	* EK::BIO1::Lecture2
* SUBJECTAREA::Topic::Sub-Topic
    - For example:
	* BC::DNA
	* BIO::CirculatorySystem::Heart
