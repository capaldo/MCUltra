# Introduction
A collaborative MCAT deck containing premed95's (reformatted), Ortho528 (reformatted), and my own cards. My cards stem from EK and KhanAcademy.

## Why?
The idea is to use Github and the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) plugin to facilitate collaboration among premeds with the hopes of producing a repository of cards. 

## How?
To add cards AND contribute to the repository, there's two ways to go about it. Both require you to sign up for a Github account.

# Making Changes
This is a bit convoluted but I'm working on an easier way to accomplish this. If this does happen to work and people start to chip in, I'll go ahead and add them as collaborators to make this process faster.

## Option 1 – Create an Issue
Create an [issue](https://github.com/capaldo/MCUltra/issues/new) with one of the following templates:

### Revision
If you notice a card is wrong, make an issue with the following:
```markdown
Reason: Revision
Card ID:
Correction:
```

### Addition
If a piece of important information is not on a card, include it using this template:
```markdown
Front:
Back:
Images (Optional):
Website (Optional):
Tags:
```

For tags, please make something along the lines of the following formatting:
#### SOURCE::IDENTIFIERS
* For example: 
```
KhanAcademy::Biomolecules::Carbohydrate
```
```
EK::BIO1::Lecture2
```
#### SUBJECTAREA::TOPIC::SUBTOPIC
* For example:
```
BC::DNA
```
```
BIO::CirculatorySystem::Heart
```

## Option 2 – Make a Pull Request
For an in-depth explanation on how to do this, please refer to [this section](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki#how-to-collaborate-via-github) on the CrowdAnki page.
